SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a cryptographic hash function with a 160 bit output.

SHA1() computes the SHA-1 message digest of the n bytes at d and places it in md (which must have space for SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH == 20 bytes of output). 
If md is NULL, the digest is placed in a static array. Note: setting md to NULL is not thread safe.

The following functions may be used if the message is not completely stored in memory:

SHA1_Init() initializes a SHA_CTX structure.

SHA1_Update() can be called repeatedly with chunks of the message to be hashed (len bytes at data).

SHA1_Final() places the message digest in md, which must have space for SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH == 20 bytes of output, and erases the SHA_CTX.
