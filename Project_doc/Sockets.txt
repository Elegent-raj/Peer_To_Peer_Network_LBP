Socket is a way of speaking to other programs using standard file descriptors.
Only one process may bind to a specific IP address and port combination using the same transport protocol. 
Otherwise, we'll have port conflicts, where multiple programs attempt to bind to the same port numbers on the same IP address using the same protocol.
To connect to another machine, we need a socket connection.
